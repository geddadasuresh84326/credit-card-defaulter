biggest threats faces by commercial banks is the risk prediction of credit clients. The
goal is to predict the probability of credit default based on credit card owner's
characteristics and payment history.

## Approach
The classical machine learning tasks like Data Exploration, Data Cleaning,
Feature Engineering, Model Building and Model Testing. Try out different machine
learning algorithms thatâ€™s best fit for the above case.

## Tech Stack Used
1. Python 
2. Flask
3. HTML,CSS 
3. Machine learning algorithms

## Infrastructure Required.

1. AWS EC2
2. AWS ECR
3. Git Actions
4. Docker

## How to run?
Before we run the project, we need AWS account to access the service like ECR and EC2 instances.
